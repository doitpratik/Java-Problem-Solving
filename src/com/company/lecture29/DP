This Lecture is about Dynamic Programming(DP)

Recursion and DP are related topic

Need of Dynamic Programming:-
    1. For reducing the calculations which are unnecessarily calculated multiple times
    2.

There are generally 2 conditions when to use dynamic programming
    1. Overlapping condition (recurring in any function)
    2. Optimal Substructure (major prob --> Subproblem --> Optimal)

 Note:- there are more than 2 conditions which are mentioned in the cormen book
